# Mnemonic Rules for Eponymous Laws

^Good afternoon and thanks for being here. Let's dive in...

# Brace yourself...

^ System diagram
^ In 2019 Cloud System
^ CTO and Platform Team
^ System diagram and devops deck

^ IAAS & DCs,  Kubernetes and CloudFoundry & Openshift
Windows and RHEL and "Unix/Linux"
All the Databases, A Drupal cherry on top
TWO Hour provisioning

^ DevEx focussed, Delivery enabling
^ security and compliance and governance
^I wasn't in a position to critique 

---

# What I said:

* How are you focussing on user experience without any users?
* Yada, yada, Agile Development... Blah, blah, blah, Lean Enterprise, etc.

# What I needed:

* Eponymous Principle:  a law named for a person (from Greek eponymos "given as a name")
* Mnemonic Rule:  a trick for recall (from Greek mnƒìmƒì "memory")

^ So about mnemonic tricks, I like this quote:

---

# Mnemonic Tricks

> To build a memory ... it has to be a little bit weird
-- Per Sederberg (Psychologist, Univeristy of Virginia)

^ weird, gross, or embarrassing.
Make them stick. 
Make them work
I will not apologize for them, PRs welcome
My thought process now

---

![inline](media/CloudFoobarySystemDiagram.png)

^ I see a hopelessly complex system diagram, and 
atop that, I visualize a poo emoji.

---

![inline](media/CloudFoobaryPoo.png)

^poop. and not just metaphorical poo but I ponder literal
feces and the eons long evolution of excrement, that is:

# Evolution of Digestion and üí©

* Worm Digestion: 
  * A simple system that works
  * Eats continually, digestive system produces bile continuously
* Human digestion:
  * A complex systems that works
  * We eat big meals, liver stores bile in the **GALL**bladder
* **Gall**: Mnemonic for ...

---

# Gall's Law

* "A complex system designed from scratch never works, and cannot be patched ... to make it work. You have to start ... with a working simple system."
 * _John Gall, M.D. 1975, General Systemantics_
* Every complex system that works has evolved from a simple system that works.
* Mnemonic: Graphic imagery, digestive system, and **GALL** bladders

^ And that's IS how I would respond today w/ complex proposals 

^How this works...  And welcome!

# Mnemonic Tricks for Eponymous Principles

* Peter Burkholder _(he/him)_
* US Gov (Cloud.gov), Chef Software, Audax Health, AARP, NIH, Research Labs
* @pburkholder most places
* Geophysicist / Seismologist / Physics Teacher
* So: THERE WILL BE A **QUIZ**

[.build-lists: false]

^Me, some of the places I've worked, and where to find me


---

# The power of Eponymous Principles

* Newton's Laws
  * Law of inertia, etc.
* Murphy's Law
  * Everything that can go wrong will
* Moore's Law
  * Compute power doubles every two years
  
^Not merely rhetorical "argument from authority" but should have 
the backing of experience and empirical evidence. 

---

# What makes for a good eponymous principle?

* True - with empirical evidence, or
* True - with weight of lived experience
* Predictive or explanatory value

^ Consider Gall's Law in this light: It is true from
lived experience and has PREDICTIVE VALUE.

---

# Speaking of predictive value...

![inline](media/CloudFate.png)

^ 2 Weeks provisioning! Over budget
^ Collapsed under its own weight
^ on to our tour of other laws. Likely familiar with:

---

# Conway's Law

"Organizations which design systems‚Ä¶are constrained to produce designs which are copies of the communication structures of these organizations"

* _Melvin Conway, 1968_
* Or: Your architecture will mirror your org chart
* _Mnemonic_: We **CON**struct systems mirroring the **WAY** we communicate
* Application: ...

^Pathological organization cultures and structures
will result in pathological technical systems. 

^ True by Experience, Predictive Value

---

# The Inverse Conway Maneuver

* Build teams to achieve the desired architecture
* Tech: Used bounded contexts and APIs along team bounds
* Orgs: Consider _Team Topologies_ (Skelton & Pais, 2019)

![right,56%](./media/team_topologies.png)

^Thoughtworks blog post 2015.
Matthew Skelton & Manuel Pais, 2019

^Another old chestnut:

--- 

# Brooks Law

"Adding [engineers] to a late software project makes it later"

* _Fred Brooks, 1975, The Mythical Man Month_
* Mnemonic: The **BROOK** went over the waterfall[^1]
* Why: onboarding time + geometrical growth in communication lines

![right](./media/waterfall.png)

[^1]: James C. **Brooks**, @shootjamesshoot / instagram

^ Water fall - Not dams and Skyscrapers
^ Agile too
^ SW is team members to communicate

# Jevons' Paradox

> As the cost of an economically useful commodity decreases,
total expenditure on the commodity grows
-- _William Stanley Jevons, 1865_


![right,fit](./media/jevon.png)

* Examples:
  * 1860s: Coal
  * 1970s: Automobile fuel efficiency
  * 2010s: Cloud spend
* See also: Moore's Law

^ James Watt steam engine. Better Efficient per unit Coal
Economist expected end to coal pollution.

^ Cloud spend does not go down with price per compute unit.

---

# Jevons' Mnemonic

* As price goes down
  **J**ust **EVEN** more demand, or
* Falling **JAVE**lin goes ever farther

![left](./media/javeleer.png)
![right](./media/jevon_mnemonic.png)

^ No apologies for mnemonic.

---

# Pareto Principle

The 80/20 rule: 80% of a project is complete in 20% of the time

* _Joseph Juran, inspired by Vilifredo Pareto, 1941_
* Mnemonic: 
  **PARE** down **TO** 80% of work with 20% effort
* Validity: Power-law distribution in process variation
  * or a _Pareto Distribution_

^ Uses: Focus on the 20% most critical findings, 
to take care of 80% of your risk

---

![](./media/pareto.png)

^ Inverse of an exponential curve

---

# Pareto Distributions

* Earthquake magnitudes
* Size of files transferred on a network
* Crimes committed by individuals
* Consecutive nights of being homeless
* Generally: Confounding Factors

![](./media/pareto.png)

---

# Pareto Principle (2)

"In the last six months, we've been able to meet the needs of one-half of our users. We can meet the needs of the other half in another six months"

* Can you spot the problem here?
  
^I'm speculating here, but 

^ Next, consider these words from GK Chesterton:

---

> If you don‚Äôt see the use of [a fence]... Go away and think. 
> <br>
>  When you can ... tell me the use of it, I may allow you to destroy it.
-- G. K. Chesterton, 1929

^ The Foolish Reformer will remove any fence in their way

^ The Intelligent Reformer will say:

---

# Chesterton's Fence

Do not remove a fence until you know why it was put up in the first place.

* Mnemonic: That **CHEST** behind the **FENCE** - it may be a danger!
* Application:
  * Comments, ADRs (Architectural Decision Records), PRs
  * Employee Retention

![left](./media/fence.png)

^ Any project more than a year old, especially platforms...

---

# Meme Laws

* ~~True - with empirical evidence~~
* ~~True - with weight of lived experience~~
* Feel true
* ~~Predictive or explanatory value~~
* Build Community

---

# Meme Laws

### Hanlon's Razor
  "Never attribute to malice what is better explained by incompetence"
  -- _Unknown_
* Mnemonic: Never attribute to _conspiracy_ what is better explained by incompetence
  -- Apocryphally __Robert A. Heinlein__
  
![right,fit](./media/puppetmasters.jpg)

^ No Hanlon known, maybe Heinlein mangled.


---

<!-- # Meme Laws (cont.) --> 

### Cunningham's Law

   "The best way to get the right answer on the internet is not to ask a question; it's to post the wrong answer."
  -- _Ward Cunningham_
  * Mnemonic: Knowledge is COMING HOME when you post the wrong answer

### Hofstadter's Law

   "It always takes longer than you expect, even when you take into account Hofstadter‚Äôs Law."
  -- _Douglas Hofstatder, 1979_ 
  * Mnemonic: **Ha!** **Later...**

![right, fit](./media/GodelEscherBach_well_loved.jpg)

^TEXT: Then: Hofstader's Law may not be a meme law, 
straddle between meme laws and useful laws.

---

# Whong's Law 

"Every government agency, everywhere is working on a ‚Äúnew system‚Äù; It will solve all of their data problems and will be ready to use in 18-24 months."
-- _Chris Whong, 2018_

* Mnemonic: Data throng done long? Wrong, says Whong.
* See also: Gall's Law, Pareto Principle

^The timeline here is key. system will still be 18-24 months away.
^Predictive value: If you come across this: insist that is solve 1 problem for 1 user in 1 month.
(The TTS DevTools team is living this with their work on Rails Template)
