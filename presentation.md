# Mnemonic Rules for Eponymous Laws

* SRECon EMEA 2024

^A brief history of this talk....

---

# Brace yourself...


^ In 2017 I was a consulting engineer with 18F/cloud.gov
and I started crossing paths with a team at the DHS CTO
office that was just getting started building a "CloudFactory" as the 
eventual platform on which DHS development teams would
build, test and run their products.

^The system diagram looked something like this slide
where basically everything from the DevOps landscape
had been vomited up into tiered system. And my heart sank.

---

^"And how is this working out for customers already working
with this system?" I asked.

^And I think you can guess the answer: They had none

^I knew that this project was destined to fail (spoiler alert: it
did), and I knew that from working on teams that practiced agile 
development and lean product design -- and from working myself on
projects that failed.

^But I wasn't in a position launch into a deep critique of their
approach, and I wished there was a pithy way to point out the
fundamental misstep they had made.

---

# What I said:

* How many customers do you have?
* Yada, yada, Agile Development, blah, blah, blah, Lean Enterprise, ...

# What I needed:

* Eponymous Principle
  * a law named for a person (from Greek eponymos "given as a name")
* Mnemonic Rule:
  * a trick for recall (from Greek mnƒìmƒì "memory")

---

# Mnemonic Tricks

"To build a memory ... it has to be a little bit weird"
- Per Sederberg (Ohio State University)

* Good mnemonics are weird, perhaps a little gross, or embarrassing.
* Make them work for you

^They stick in your memory. So my though process now would run something like this:

^poop. and not just metaphorical poo but I ponder literal
crap and the eons long

# Evolution of Digestion and üí©

* Worm Digestion: 
  * A simple system that works
  * Eat continually, liver produces bile continuously
* Human digestion:
  * A complex systems that works
  * We eat big meals, liver stores bile in the **GALL** bladder
* **Gall**: Mnemonic for ...


^Evolution of Crap and the evolution of digestive systems. Because millions 
of years the precursor to our dig system would've been akin to
a worms's digestive system, where the worm is continually eating,
the liver is continually producing bile, and the lower intestine
is continually pooping.

^By contrast, we don't eat continually. We eat meals, sometimes big ones,
and the bile produced by our liver is stored in our Gall bladder so
its available to digest those meals. 

^It's a complex system that works, that evolved from a simple system that
worked

^And now we have our Mnenomic for 

---

# Gall's Law

* "A complex system designed from scratch never works, and cannot be patched ... to make it work. You have to start ... with a working simple system."
 * _John Gall, M.D. 1975, General Systemantics_
* Every complex system that works has evolved from a simple system that works.
* Mnemonic: Graphic imagery, digestive system, and **GALL** bladders

^So the crappy system diagram brings me around from crap to
worm crap, to human crap, to the Gall bladder, and I can invoke
Gall's Law:

^Every complex system that works has evolved from a simple system that works.

^How this works...  And welcome!

# Mnemonic Tricks for Eponymous Principles

* Peter Burkholder _(he/him)_
* US Gov (Cloud.gov), Chef Software, ..., Research Labs
* Geophysicist

^Hi, I'm Peter Burkholder, and welcome to Mnemonic Rule for Eponymous
Principles. I'm currently a customer success engineer for Cloud.gov, the
US Government's Platform-as-a-Service for Public Servants. Before going to
work for .gov 8 years ago I worked for Chef Software, a few other startups, 
and before that, for research labs including the US National Institutes of
Health, Nat'l center for atmospheric researth, the Pacific NW Seismic Network
because I first came into Unix administration as a graduate student in 
seismology.

^I'm glad to be here today to share with you the eponymous principles I have found 
useful in my work, and the mnemonic tricks I use to call them up, some context on how to apply them.

^Caveat: Some of my mnemonic tricks are weird, stupid, embarrassing or all three.
You may want to come up with your own. Because I think there's real power
to eponymous principles

---

# The power of Eponymous Principles

* Newton's Laws
  * Law of inertia, etc.
* Murphy's Law
  * Everything that can go wrong will
* Moore's Law
  * Compute power doubles every two years
  
^There is weight that is not merely
rhetorical "argument from authority" but should have
the backing of experience and empirical evidence. 

^You can't really argue w/ Newton's law (unless relativistic)

^Because
while Murphys Law doesn't have evident per se, it is
still the backbone of our work in Disaster Recovery plan, 
business continuity plans and much else the SRE community does.

^And Moore's Law (paraphrased here) has mostly held true for over 50 years


---

# What makes for a good eponymous principle?

* True - with empirical evidence
* True - with weight of lived experience
* Predictive or explanatory value

^ So, in addition to having "truthiness" is should 
also have predictive or explanatory value

^ Consider Gall's Law in this light: It is theoretically true, and true from
lived experience and has predictive value. 

---

# Speaking of predictive value...

# Conway's Law

"Organizations which design systems‚Ä¶are constrained to produce designs which are copies of the communication structures of these organizations"

* _Melvin Conway, 1968_
* Or: Your architecture will mirror your org chart
* _Mnemonic_: We **CON**struct systems mirroring the **WAY** we communicate
* Application: ... next slide ...

^Pathological organization cultures and structures
will result in pathological technical systems. This is true
by weight of lived experience AND is has predictive/explantory
value. Consider the .... (next slide)

---

# The Inverse Conway Maneuver

* Build teams to achieve the desired architecture
* Tech: Used bounded contexts and APIs along team bounds
* Orgs: Consider _Team Topologies_ (Skelton & Pais, 2019)

(image: Team Topology cover)

^This technique was named by Thoughtworks in a blog post form 2015.
To apply this, you should definitely consider reading Team Topologies,
the book and the website, by Matthew Skelton & Manuel Pais, 2019

--- 

# Brooks Law

"Adding [engineers] to a late software project makes it later"

* _Fred Brooks, 1975, The Mythical Man Month_
* Mnemonic: The **BROOK** went over the waterfall
* Why: onboarding time + geometrical growth in communication lines

^This is not true just of Waterfall development, but 
Agile too, and there's good theoretical reasons. While a dam
or skyscraper could be built faster with more workers,
SW is constrained by the ability of team members to communicate
about their work. The more engs you have, the more lines of 
communication you have to maintain (let alone onboarding), and 
the more work slows down.


---

# Jevons' Paradox

As the cost of economically useful commodity decreases,
total expenditure on the commodity grows

* _William Stanley Jevons, 1865_
* Mnenomic: Something to do with ancient javelineers
* Examples: 
  * 1860s: Coal
  * 1970s: Automobile fuel efficiency
  * 2010s: Cloud spend
* See also: Moore's Law

^ If anyone you're talking to thinks cloud spend is going to go
down, brandish this. Cloud spend provides returns on your spend
that simply encourage more spend. Same with Coal, and fuel efficiency.

# Pareto Principle

"the vital few and the useful many" (or the 80/20) rule

* _Joseph Juran, inspired by Vilifredo Pareto, 1941_
* Mnemonic: _(under construction)_
* 80% of a project is complete in 20% of the time
* Validity: Power-law distribution in process variation
  * or a _Pareto Distribution_

---

# Pareto Principle (2)

"In the last six months, we've been able to 
meet the needs of one-half of our users. We can meet the needs
of the other half in another six months"

* Can you spot the problem here?
  
^I'm speculating here, but FAFSA.... and students
whose parents didn't have SSNs, or had 2000 as birth
year, makes me think...

^SO MUCH SAY HERE! See notes

# Meme Laws

* ~~True - with empirical evidence~~
* ~~True - with weight of lived experience~~
* Feel true
* ~~Predictive or explanatory value~~
* Build Community

---

# Meme Laws

* Cunningham's Law
  * "The best way to get the right answer on the internet is not to ask a question; it's to post the wrong answer."
  * _Ward Cunningham_
  * Mnemonic: Knowledge is COMING HOME when you post the wrong answer
* Hofstadter's Law
  * "It always takes longer than you expect, even when you take into account Hofstadter‚Äôs Law."
  * _Douglas Hofstatder, 1979_ (image: GEB cover)
  * Mnemonic: **Ha!** **Later...**

^TEXT: Then: Hofstader's Law may not be a  meme law, nor are 
laws that are corollarys to it, can straddle between meme laws
and useful laws.

---

# Whong's Law 

"Every government agency, everywhere is working on a ‚Äúnew system‚Äù; It will solve all of their data problems and will be ready to use in 18-24 months."

* _Chris Whong, 2018_
* Mnemonic: Data throng done long? Wrong, says Whong.

^The timeline here is key. In six months, the system will still be 18-24 months away.
That system diagram we saw in the beginning? How far from completion do you think it way. (Pause)
18-24 months.

* See also: Gall's Law, Pareto Principle

^Predictive value: If you come across this: insist that is solve 1 problem for 1 user in 1 month.
