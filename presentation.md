# Mnemonic Rules for Eponymous Laws

* SRECon EMEA 2024
* Peter Burkholder

[.build-lists: false]

^Good afternoon and thanks for being here. Let's dive in...

# Brace yourself...

^ System diagram
^ In 2019 Cloud Foobar
^ CTO and Platform Team
^ System diagram and devops vomit

---

![inline](media/CloudFoobarySystemDiagram.png)

^ Note Components

^ 2 hour env provisioni

^ DevEx focussed, Delivery enabling

^ security and compliance and governance

^I wasn't in a position to critique 

---

# What I said:

* How are you focussing on user experience without any users?
* Yada, yada, Agile Development... Blah, blah, blah, Lean Enterprise, etc.

# What I needed:

* Eponymous Principle:  a law named for a person (from Greek eponymos "given as a name")
* Mnemonic Rule:  a trick for recall (from Greek mnƒìmƒì "memory")

^ So about mnemonic tricks, I like this quote:

---

# Mnemonic Tricks

> To build a memory ... it has to be a little bit weird
-- Per Sederberg (Univeristy of Virginia)

^ weird, gross, or embarrassing.
Make them stick. 
Make them work
My thought process now

---

![inline](media/CloudFoobarySystemDiagram.png)

^ I see a hopelessly complex system diagram, and 
atop that, I visualize a poo emoji.

---

![inline](media/CloudFoobaryPoo.png)

^poop. and not just metaphorical poo but I ponder literal
crap and the eons long evolution of poop, that is:

# Evolution of Digestion and üí©

* Worm Digestion: 
  * A simple system that works
  * Eat continually, liver produces bile continuously
* Human digestion:
  * A complex systems that works
  * We eat big meals, liver stores bile in the **GALL**bladder
* **Gall**: Mnemonic for ...

---

# Gall's Law

* "A complex system designed from scratch never works, and cannot be patched ... to make it work. You have to start ... with a working simple system."
 * _John Gall, M.D. 1975, General Systemantics_
* Every complex system that works has evolved from a simple system that works.
* Mnemonic: Graphic imagery, digestive system, and **GALL** bladders

^ And that's IS how I would respond today w/ complex proposals (OSCAL anyone?)

^How this works...  And welcome!

# Mnemonic Tricks for Eponymous Principles

* Peter Burkholder _(he/him)_
* US Gov (Cloud.gov), Chef Software, Audax Health, AARP, NIH, Research Labs
* Geophysicist / Seismologist / Physics Teacher
* So: THERE WILL BE A **QUIZ**

[.build-lists: false]

^I'm glad to be here today to share with you the eponymous principles I have found 
useful in my work, and the mnemonic tricks I use to call them up, some context on how to apply them.


---

# The power of Eponymous Principles

* Newton's Laws
  * Law of inertia, etc.
* Murphy's Law
  * Everything that can go wrong will
* Moore's Law
  * Compute power doubles every two years
  
^There is weight that is not merely
rhetorical "argument from authority" but should have
the backing of experience and empirical evidence. 


---

# What makes for a good eponymous principle?

* True - with empirical evidence, or
* True - with weight of lived experience
* Predictive or explanatory value

^ So, in addition to having "truth value it should 
also have predictive or explanatory value

^ Consider Gall's Law in this light: It is true from
lived experience and has PREDICTIVE VALUE.

---

# Speaking of predictive value...

![inline](media/CloudFate.png)

^ 2 Weeks provisioning! Over budget
^ Collapsed
^ on to our tour of other laws:

---

# Conway's Law

"Organizations which design systems‚Ä¶are constrained to produce designs which are copies of the communication structures of these organizations"

* _Melvin Conway, 1968_
* Or: Your architecture will mirror your org chart
* _Mnemonic_: We **CON**struct systems mirroring the **WAY** we communicate (üë∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è‚û°Ô∏è)
* Application: ...

^Pathological organization cultures and structures
will result in pathological technical systems. 

^ True by Experience, Predictive Value

---

# The Inverse Conway Maneuver

* Build teams to achieve the desired architecture
* Tech: Used bounded contexts and APIs along team bounds
* Orgs: Consider _Team Topologies_ (Skelton & Pais, 2019)

# Brooks Law

"Adding [engineers] to a late software project makes it later"

* _Fred Brooks, 1975, The Mythical Man Month_
* Mnemonic: The **BROOK** went over the waterfall[^1]
* Why: onboarding time + geometrical growth in communication lines

[^1]: James C. **Brooks**, @shootjamesshoot / instagram

^ Water fall - Not dams and Skyscrapers
^ Agile too
^ SW is team members to communicate

# Jevons' Paradox

> As the cost of an economically useful commodity decreases,
total expenditure on the commodity grows
-- _William Stanley Jevons, 1865_


![right,fit](./media/jevon.png)

* Examples:
  * 1860s: Coal
  * 1970s: Automobile fuel efficiency
  * 2010s: Cloud spend
* See also: Moore's Law

^ James Watt steam engine economists 
forecasting an end to the pollution as the efficiency 
of Watt‚Äôs new engine reduced coal per task

^ If anyone you're talking to thinks cloud spend is going to go
down, brandish this. Cloud spend provides returns on your spend
that simply encourage more spend. Same with Coal, and fuel efficiency.

# Jevons' Mnemonic

* As price goes down
  **J**ust **EVEN** more demand
* Falling **JAVE**lin goes ever farther

# Pareto Principle

"the vital few and the useful many" (or the 80/20) rule

* _Joseph Juran, inspired by Vilifredo Pareto, 1941_
* 80% of a project is complete in 20% of the time
* Mnemonic: 
  **PARE** down **TO** 80% of work with 20% effort
* Validity: Power-law distribution in process variation
  * or a _Pareto Distribution_

^ Uses: Focus on the 20% most critical findings, 
to take care of 80% of your risk

---

![](./media/pareto.png)

^ Inverse of an expoential curve

---

# Pareto Distributions

* Earthquake magnitudes
* Size of files transferred on a network
* Crimes committed by individuals
* Consecutive nights of being homeless
* Generally: Confounding Factors

![](./media/pareto.png)

---

# Pareto Principle (2)

"In the last six months, we've been able to meet the needs of one-half of our users. We can meet the needs of the other half in another six months"

* Can you spot the problem here?
  
^I'm speculating here, but FAFSA.... and students
whose parents didn't have SSNs, or had 2000 as birth
year, makes me think...

^ CHESTERTON's Fence

---

> If you don‚Äôt see the use of [a fence], I certainly won‚Äôt let you clear it away. Go away and think. 
> <br>
> Then, when you can come back and tell me that you do see the use of it, I may allow you to destroy it.
-- G. K. Chesterton, 1929

^ The Foolish Reformer will remove any fence in their way

^ The Intelligent Reformer will say:

---

# Chesterton's Fence

Do not remove a fence until you know why it was put up in the first place.

* Mnemonic: That **CHEST** behind the **FENCE** - it may be a danger!
* Application:
  * Comments, ADRs (Architectural Decision Records), PRs
  * Employee Retention

# Meme Laws

* ~~True - with empirical evidence~~
* ~~True - with weight of lived experience~~
* Feel true
* ~~Predictive or explanatory value~~
* Build Community

# Meme Laws

* Hanlon's Razor

  "Never attribute to malice what is better explained by incompetence"
  -- Apocraphally __Robert A. Heinlein__
* Cranstoning
  -- See also "Yak Shaving"

# Meme Laws (cont.)

* Cunningham's Law

   "The best way to get the right answer on the internet is not to ask a question; it's to post the wrong answer."
  -- _Ward Cunningham_
  * Mnemonic: Knowledge is COMING HOME when you post the wrong answer
* Hofstadter's Law

   "It always takes longer than you expect, even when you take into account Hofstadter‚Äôs Law."
  -- _Douglas Hofstatder, 1979_ 
  * Mnemonic: **Ha!** **Later...**

![right, fit](./media/GodelEscherBach_well_loved.jpg)

^TEXT: Then: Hofstader's Law may not be a  meme law, nor are 
laws that are corollarys to it, can straddle between meme laws
and useful laws.

---

# Whong's Law 

"Every government agency, everywhere is working on a ‚Äúnew system‚Äù; It will solve all of their data problems and will be ready to use in 18-24 months."

* _Chris Whong, 2018_
* Mnemonic: Data throng done long? Wrong, says Whong.

^The timeline here is key. In six months, the system will still be 18-24 months away.
That system diagram we saw in the beginning? How far from completion do you think it way. (Pause)
18-24 months.

* See also: Gall's Law, Pareto Principle

^Predictive value: If you come across this: insist that is solve 1 problem for 1 user in 1 month.
(The TTS DevTools team is living this with their work on Rails Template)
